# Framework Plugins

## Implementations

All current plugin implementations are based off the JavaScript contained in [Instrumentation through Proxying](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/course-work/project489/2023/gulabjaye/dom-instrumentation-to-display-provenance-data/-/tree/main/JavaScript%20Instrumentation/Instrumentation%20through%20Proxying). The format of the JavaScript has been changed to match each plugin type.
